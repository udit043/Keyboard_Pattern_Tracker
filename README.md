# Keyboard_Pattern_Tracker

I have created a program using OpenCV. This program shows you the alphabets you type on the keyboard graphically by drawing lines between previously and currently pressed alphabets.

Using 'Tab' key will produce new window for working.
Using 'space' key will produce new pattern in same window.

This is small program but can be used in security purposes.
